# K8S-Node-API
This repo contains sample code on node.js rest-api and integration with various application such as Kafka, Redis and Cassandra. At last we provide all k8s related deployment files that can be used in kubernetes environment to deploy an application as stateless/stateful service.

whole idea of this repo is to get understanding on how we can integrate various applications, exposed as Rest-API and then how we can do the k8s deployment. We will provide sample code for following rest End point (only GET and POST Method included here) and it's deployment in kubernetes environment:-

1. Node.Js and Kafka Integration
2. Node.Js and Redis Integration
3. Node.Js and Apache Cassandra Integration
4. Node.js and MongoDB
